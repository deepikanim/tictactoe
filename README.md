# Tic Tac Toe #

Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build it.

Open index.html in Chrome/Mozilla/Edge browser.

To start,

1. Enter size. A valid size is a number between 3 and 100.
2. Hit "new game" button. 

A size * size grid will be drawn. 

Human starts first. Click in any cell you'd like. It's always an 'X' for human and 'O' for computer.

The computer is a weaker player here.

Game is over when either Human or Computer wins or there is a draw.

You can restart the game by refreshing the browser.
